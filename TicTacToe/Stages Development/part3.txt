2.compare moveA (number of the place that user click) with number in the checkList (checking moveA is in the list or not)
3.if user click outside the plot -> moveA == 10 -> not in checkList -> require click on proper place
4.if user click on proper place -> moveA = a number (1 to 9) -> eliminate that number from checkList -> next time if user click on same place -> that number is already eliminated from checkList -> require click on proper place
