part 1 of project: generate a tictactoe board and prompt user's click coordinate (x,y) on that plot

expected:
1.generate a tictactoe board
2.prompt user's click coordinate (x,y) on that plot (tictactoe board)

implement:
1.generate a board by plot, that plot has axis y (0,3) and axis (0,3)
2.draw lines to make that board to tictactoe board
3.use ginput() to prompt coordinate x,y multiple time, x and y return values between 0 to 3 everytime user click on the board

actual output: 
2 values that between 0 and 3

case1:
0.4891
